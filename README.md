## About

TaskStalker is my personal portfolio / web project, showcasing my skills, work, and personality.  
It uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling and **DaisyUI** components to speed up UI development.  
The site is deployed via **Vercel** for seamless CI/CD and hosting.  
This repo is also a place to experiment, refine, and extend.
